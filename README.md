## :wave: Overview

Welcome to my home Kubernetes cluster.

### :warning: Note: I am currently migrating to a new gitops structure. This means stuff can/will break until the dust has settled.

Lots of fun (to me at least :wink:) stuff can be found, poke around my [cluster](./cluster/) directory to see what my cluster is running. Feel free to open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/bjw-s/k8s-gitops/issues/new).

For more information, head on over to my [docs](https://bjw-s.github.io/k8s-gitops/).

## :handshake:&nbsp; Thanks

A lot of inspiration for my cluster came from the people that have shared their clusters over at [awesome-home-kubernetes](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/awesome-home-kubernetes)
