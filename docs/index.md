# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for [bjw-s/k8s-gitops](https://github.com/bjw-s/k8s-gitops){target=_blank}.

This repository _is_ my home Kubernetes cluster in a declarative state. [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2){target=_blank} watches my [cluster](https://github.com/bjw-s/k8s-gitops/tree/main/cluster/){target=_blank} folder and makes the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

Feel free to open a [Github issue](https://github.com/bjw-s/k8s-gitops/issues/new/choose){target=_blank} or join the [k8s@home Discord](https://discord.gg/sTMX7Vh){target=_blank} if you have any questions.

## Thanks

A lot of inspiration for my cluster came from the people that have shared their clusters over at [awesome-home-kubernetes](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/awesome-home-kubernetes){target=_blank}
